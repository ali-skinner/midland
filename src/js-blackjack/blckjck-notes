dealerDrawCard funct - similiar to hit me funct; but the goal is so use the guts of this funct to eval the dealer hand too. this funct needs the ace value rendering funct, add to dealerSum, if else stmnt if dealerSum over 21 = bust alert; if under 21 just add card.value to the dealerSum array; dealer STAYS on 17; need the hidden card syntax at some point.

    hiddenDealerCard - dont show the face of the first card UNTIL some one busts?

playerHitMe funct - button on click = draw a card;  this funct needs the ace value rendering funct, add to playerSum, if else stmnt if playerSum over 21 = bust alert; if under 21 just add card.value to the playerSum array.

stayPut function - playerSum array is complete; dealers turn - active dealerDrawCard funt; eval against whoWON.

whoWON funct - use to calc playerSum vs dealerSum; print on screen

need to clear out each funct / reset to 0 / []

print cards on screen - use the pngs?

countRounds - cound rounds played

startGame - use a start button? use window event? on this event, deal 2 cards to each player and dealer; player are face up; dealer first card = hidden

annimate shuffling?
