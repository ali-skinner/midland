    <div style="padding: 100px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
        Build a Simon Says game. It could look similar to image simon.jpg, but it can look however you want:
        <br>---------------
        Create a start button that the user can click to start the game
        Each button is a certain color
        When the game starts, pick a button at random that lights up its color for 1-2 seconds
        <br>--------------
        If the user clicks that button, the game repeats that button and then adds another
        This keeps going for 5 cycles (or whatever number you'd like), or until the player picks a wrong button
        example: red, red-blue, red-blue-green, red-blue-green-yellow, red-blue-green-yellow-green
    
        <br>--------------
        Display a victory screen/alert after the player successfully completes 5 cycles
        Display a defeat screen/alert if the player clicks a wrong button </div>
