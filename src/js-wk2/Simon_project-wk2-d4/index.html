    <!-- If the user clicks that button, the game repeats that button and then adds another; do we need a loop? keep this going for 5 cycles OR until player gets a button wrong -->

    <!-- need a vivtory screen for 5 cycle completion -->
    <!--  need a DEFEATED screen if push wrong button-->

<!-- b4 a button is clicked, it needs to light up, math.random maybe will pick a random color to display, should i assign the color blocks a number for math.random -->

    
    Build a Simon Says game. It could look similar to image simon.jpg, but it can look however you want:
    ---------------
    Create a start button that the user can click to start the game
    Each button is a certain color
    When the game starts, pick a button at random that lights up its color for 1-2 seconds
    --------------
    If the user clicks that button, the game repeats that button and then adds another
    This keeps going for 5 cycles (or whatever number you'd like), or until the player picks a wrong button
    example: red, red-blue, red-blue-green, red-blue-green-yellow, red-blue-green-yellow-green
    
    --------------
    Display a victory screen/alert after the player successfully completes 5 cycles
    Display a defeat screen/alert if the player clicks a wrong button
