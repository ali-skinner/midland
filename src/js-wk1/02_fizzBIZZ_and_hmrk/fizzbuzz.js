// FIZZBUZZ

// Run through all the numbers from 1-100
// Log the number and "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and 5
// Log the number and "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
// Log the number and "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
// Log the number if none of the above conditions are true

// EXTRA: 

// Modify the FizzBuzz problem to allow the user to choose a max integer.
// (example: the user is prompted for a number, they choose 15, so the problem runs through the numbers 1 to 15)
