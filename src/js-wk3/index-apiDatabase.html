    <p>You will be taking what you have learned so far this week to build a mobile responsive movie database search
        engine. Taking the following steps, allow for a user to search for a movie on OMDB to see what movies share that
        title.

    <p>- Come up with layout
        - Build elements / containers / etc
        - Event listener to submit button to do the things
        - Count amount of letters they input and do appropriate action
        - Read API Documentation to see what format you will get a response in / what you need to send
        - Fetch data from the API
        - Display error message to DOM if something went wrong
        - Use data to display to DOM<br></p>

    ---more -- >
    - Sign up for a personal API key from OMDBAPI
    - Utilize the information on the page to see what kind of format a request needs to be made in to return correct
    information.
    -Create a simple search box that allows for the user to search for a movie. They should be able to enter ANY of the
    following information but a search field is required for you to send a request to the API:
    - Search Field (title) - Do not allow for an API call without at least 3 characters in this field
    - Type (Make a select box for this)
    - Year - Your choice of input type
    - If an error occurred, let the user know. Otherwise display the data to the page.
    - Since only 10 items are returned, figure out how many items WOULD have been sent and let the user know.
    optional: Let the user pick a page out of that many to select to. This will be a lesson in the wonders /
    frustrations of pagination.
    Add styling and additional functionality as time permits.</p>
